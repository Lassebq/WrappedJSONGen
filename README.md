# WrappedJSONGen

An utility used to generate Minecraft version JSONs with [LaunchWrapper](https://github.com/MCPHackers/LaunchWrapper) as the launch method.

It also includes a set of updated libraries, like [LWJGL](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl) and [Paulscode Sound System](http://www.paulscode.com/forum/index.php?topic=4.0), which work better with legacy Minecraft versions.

Currently supported range of versions: `rd-132211` - `1.12.2`
